# Tasks

- maintain both of: Web & Mobile app
- clean code and separate routes in services & utils
- case of servers are not run, display 404 error
-
## Authorization

*Protect Routes of APIS*
only users could edit their own [posts, comments, profile...]
only admin could edit all after login

## Authentication

*Security Improvements*

- HTTP-Only Cookies for better security.
- Protect sensitive endpoints with CSRF protection.
- Use Secure, HttpOnly, and SameSite=strict cookies.

*Account Lockout After Multiple Failed Attempts*
ðŸ’¡ Why? Prevents brute-force attacks
âœ… If a user fails 5 times, lock the account for 5-15 minutes
âœ… Optional: Send an email alert about suspicious activity

*Device & Session Management*
ðŸ’¡ Why? Let users track and log out from other devices
âœ… Store user sessions in database or Redis
âœ… Allow users to log out from specific devices

*Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)*
ðŸ’¡ Why? Necessary when adding admin & moderator roles
âœ… Users (default permissions: post, comment, like, etc.)
âœ… Moderators (delete comments, mute users)
âœ… Admins (manage everything)

*Email Change Verification*
ðŸ’¡ Why? Prevents unauthorized email changes
âœ… If a user wants to update their email, send an OTP to the old email
âœ… Only update if the OTP is verified

*Remember Me (Persistent Login)*
ðŸ’¡ Why? Let users stay logged in without re-entering passwords
âœ… Short-lived JWT (1 hour) + Refresh token (30 days)
âœ… Store refresh tokens securely in HttpOnly cookies

*User enter last password*
âœ… Inform by error message: this password was updated on #date (facebook)

Why? Faster sign-ups & better security

### OTP & Verification
